<h2>Welcome ðŸ‘‹</h2>

This is the Unity sample project for the Web3 Angry Birds video.

You will find two scenes:

MintNFT scene --> Mint NFT using SmartContract and transfer it to wallet address.
Game scene --> Angry Birds game. Your character will be a local image or the image retrieved from the NFT ðŸ˜„
As a demo project it is thought to be run in the Editor.

Enjoy!
